# 🐾 Pet Simulation Project

This is a **simple console-based pet simulation game** built with Python. The goal is to simulate the care of a virtual pet by managing its basic needs and interacting with it in fun ways!

## 🎯 Features

- **Choose Your Pet:** Select from three types — `cat`, `dog`, or `fish`.
- **Name Your Pet:** Give your pet a unique name!
- **Toys Based on Type:** Each pet has toys specific to its type.
- **Pet Actions:**
  - `eat()` – Feeds the pet, reduces hunger, and boosts happiness.
  - `sleep()` – Restores pet's energy.
  - `play()` – Increases happiness but decreases energy and increases hunger.
  - `train(trick)` – Teach your pet new tricks!
  - `show_tricks()` – Displays all learned tricks.
  - `get_status()` – Prints current stats: name, type, hunger, energy, happiness, tricks, and toys.

## 🔧 How It Works

- When the game starts, users are prompted to:
  - Choose a pet type.
  - Give the pet a name.
- A main menu allows users to interact with their pet.
- Each action affects the pet's stats differently.
- The pet remembers all the tricks it's been trained!

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Classes and Objects
- Methods and Constructors
- Lists and Dictionaries
- Input validation
- Simple game loops and conditionals

## ✅ Sample Usage
